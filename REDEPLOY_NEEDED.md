# ⚠️ Manual Redeploy Needed!

## ✅ **Good News:**
- PostgreSQL has **188 patterns** ✅
- Database connection works perfectly ✅
- `DATABASE_URL` is correct ✅

## ⚠️ **Issue:**
**Render hasn't restarted the service yet!**

The API is still using the old SQLite connection because:
- Environment variable changes don't always trigger auto-restart
- The running containers cached the old `DATABASE_URL`

---

## 🔧 **Fix: Manual Redeploy**

### **Go to Render Dashboard:**

1. **Navigate to**: https://dashboard.render.com
2. **Click**: `legend-api` service
3. **Look for** "Manual Deploy" button (top right)
4. **Click**: "Clear build cache & deploy"
   - Or just "Deploy latest commit"
5. **Wait**: ~5 minutes for deploy to complete

---

## 🧪 **After Redeploy, Test:**

```bash
# Should show 188!
curl -s 'https://legend-api.onrender.com/v1/meta/status'
```

**Expected**:
```json
{
    "last_scan_time": "2025-09-29T07:45:45",
    "rows_total": 188,  ← Should be 188!
    "patterns_daily_span_days": 2,
    "version": "0.1.0"
}
```

Then check dashboard:
```bash
# Should show 188 patterns!
curl 'https://legend-ai-dashboard.vercel.app/'
```

## 💡 **Why This Happens:**

When you change an environment variable in Render:
- ✅ The variable is saved
- ❌ But running containers don't reload it automatically
- 🔧 Need manual redeploy to restart with new env

---

## 📊 **What We Verified:**

```bash
✅ Database connection works
✅ Can query: SELECT COUNT(*) → 188 rows
✅ Can fetch patterns:
   • NVDA: VCP
   • PLTR: VCP
   • CRWD: VCP
   ... and 185 more!
```

**Everything is ready. Just needs one redeploy!** 🚀

---

**Go trigger that manual deploy now!** 🔧
