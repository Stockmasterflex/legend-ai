 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

What Guarantees Success

 Daily Execution Consistency - 5-6 hours every single day 

 Quality Over 

Quantity - Better to do less but do it well 
Relationships unlock 70% of opportunities 
Room beats any degree 
burnout
What Destroys Progress

 Network-First Approach - 
 Technical Proof - Working Legend 

 Marathon Mindset - Sustainable pace prevents 

 Planning Paralysis - Stop planning, start executing 

 Perfectionism - Ship 
 Isolation - Network constantly, don't work alone 

good enough, iterate quickly
